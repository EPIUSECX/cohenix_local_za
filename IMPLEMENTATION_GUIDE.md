- Display in **Employees** table

**Verify:**

  - Tax rebates (age-based)
  - Medical tax credits
  - Previous months' tax paid
- Calculates UIF (1%, capped at R177.12)
- Calculates SDL (1%)
- Calculates ETI (if eligible):
  - Age 18-29
  - Employment start date < 24 months ago
  - Remuneration within ETI brackets
- Applies fringe benefit taxation:
  - Company car (CO2-based)
  - Housing benefit
  - Low-interest loans
  - Other benefits

**Progress:**
- Shows progress bar
- "X salary slips created"

### Step 5: Review Salary Slips

3. Open individual salary slips

**Review Earnings:**

  - Second 12 months: R250-R500

> **Common Issues to Check:**
> - PAYE too high? Check if tax directives applied

- **Make and Model**: Toyota Corolla 1.6

**Vehicle Details:**
- **Purchase Date**: 2023-06-01
- **Purchase Price**: R350,000
- **Current Value**: R320,000

**CO2 Emissions (Critical for taxation):**
- **CO2 Emissions (g/km)**: 120 (from vehicle spec)
- **Emissions Category**: System calculates:
  - 0-120 g/km: 1.0x multiplier
  - 121-160 g/km: 1.25x multiplier
  - 161-200 g/km: 1.5x multiplier
  - 201+ g/km: 1.75x multiplier

**Period:**
- **From Date**: 2024-01-01
- **To Date**: 2024-12-31 (or leave blank for ongoing)

**Click Calculate** button

**Monthly Taxable Value Formula:**
```
Base Value = Purchase Price or Current Value (lower of two)
Monthly Value = (Base Value × 3.5%) ÷ 12
CO2 Multiplier = Based on emissions category
Taxable Value = Monthly Value × CO2 Multiplier
```

**Example:**
- Purchase Price: R350,000
- Current Value: R320,000 (use this - lower)
- Base calculation: R320,000 × 3.5% = R11,200/year
- Monthly: R11,200 ÷ 12 = R933
- CO2 Emissions: 120 g/km = 1.0x multiplier
- **Monthly Taxable Value: R933**

**Submit** the Company Car Benefit

Click **Generate from Salary Slips** button

**System calculates:**

**Income Section:**

### Step 3: Generate EMP501 Reconciliation

**What is EMP501?**
Annual reconciliation of all EMP201 submissions and IRP5 certificates.

**Due Dates:**
- **Interim**: May 31st (March-August period)
- **Final**: November 30th (September-February period)

#### Create EMP501

1. Go to **SA Tax > EMP501 Reconciliation > New**
2. **Company**: Your company

7. **Save**

Click **Fetch from EMP201 and IRP5** button

**System consolidates:**

**Part A: EMP201 Submissions**
- Sums all 12 monthly EMP201 submissions
- Total PAYE, UIF, SDL, ETI for the year

**Part B: IRP5 Certificates**
- Sums all IRP5 certificates issued
- Total remuneration, PAYE, UIF, retirement

**Reconciliation:**
- Compares Part A vs Part B
- Identifies discrepancies
- Calculates over/under payment

### Step 4: Review EMP501 Totals

**EMP501 Summary:**

| Description | EMP201 Total | IRP5 Total | Variance |
|-------------|--------------|------------|----------|
| Remuneration | R6,000,000 | R6,000,000 | R0 |
| PAYE | R900,000 | R900,000 | R0 |
| UIF (Employee) | R24,000 | R24,000 | R0 |
| UIF (Employer) | R24,000 | R24,000 | R0 |
| SDL | R60,000 | - | R0 |
| ETI | -R144,000 | - | R0 |

**Ideal Outcome:** Zero variance

**If Variance Exists:**
- Investigate cause (missing EMP201, incorrect IRP5, etc.)
- Make corrections
- Re-generate EMP501

### Step 5: Export EMP501 for SARS

**CSV Export Method:**

1. Open EMP501 Reconciliation (submitted)
2. Click **Export CSV** button
3. Download `EMP501_2024-2025_Company.csv`

**Or XML Export:**

1. Click **Generate XML** button
2. Download `EMP501_2024-2025_Company.xml`
3. XML includes all employee details and amounts

### Step 6: Submit to SARS eFiling

**Via SARS eFiling Portal:**

1. Login to [SARS eFiling](https://www.sarsefiling.co.za)
2. Go to **Returns > Employer Returns**
3. Select **EMP501 - Annual Reconciliation**
4. **Tax Year**: 2024-2025
5. **Upload CSV or XML** (or enter manually)
6. **Review totals** on SARS system
7. **Submit** return
8. **Receive acknowledgment** from SARS

**Or Bulk IRP5 Submission:**

1. In SARS eFiling
2. Go to **Employer Returns > IRP5/IT3(a) Bulk Submission**
3. **Upload XML** with all IRP5s
4. SARS processes bulk submission
5. Receive confirmation

### Step 7: Generate IT3b Certificates

**What is IT3b?**
Employer certificate for employees showing tax paid (similar to IRP5 but for employee retention).

#### Single IT3b

1. Go to **SA Tax > IT3b Certificate > New**
2. **Company**: Your company
3. **Tax Year**: 2024-2025
4. **Certificate Number**: Auto-generated
5. **Save**

Click **Generate from EMP201** button

**System populates:**
- Total PAYE paid for year
- Total UIF paid
- Total SDL paid
- ETI received

**Print/Email to Employee:**
- Click **Print**
- Or **Email** directly to employee

#### Bulk Generate IT3b

1. Go to **SA Tax > IT3b Certificate**
2. Click **Menu > Bulk Generate IT3b**
3. **Tax Year**: 2024-2025
4. **Generate**

**System creates IT3b for company** (not per employee - one certificate for employer).

### Step 8: Handle Discrepancies

**Common Discrepancies:**

**Issue 1: EMP201 total ≠ IRP5 total**
- **Cause**: Employee left mid-year, final payroll not included
- **Fix**: Create final salary slip, re-generate IRP5

**Issue 2: SARS shows different PAYE amount**
- **Cause**: Previous tax year adjustments
- **Fix**: Check prior year IRP5s, make correction submission

**Issue 3: ETI claimed but not approved by SARS**
- **Cause**: Employee doesn't meet eligibility criteria
- **Fix**: Review ETI logs, remove ineligible ETI, re-submit EMP501

### Success Indicator

- ✅ IRP5 certificates generated for all employees
- ✅ All IRP5s verified and submitted
- ✅ EMP501 reconciliation created
- ✅ Zero variance between EMP201 and IRP5 totals
- ✅ EMP501 submitted to SARS (by May 31 or Nov 30)

## 23. Troubleshooting & FAQs

### Common Issues

**Q: ETI not calculating on salary slip**

A: Check:
1. Employee age < 30 (ETI eligibility)
2. Employment tenure < 24 months
3. ETI slabs exist for tax year
4. Salary within ETI bands (R2,000-R6,500)
5. Payroll Settings > "Disable ETI" = unchecked

**Q: PAYE amount seems incorrect**

A: Verify:
1. Employee tax rebates configured
2. Medical tax credits applied (if dependants)
3. Tax directive active (overrides standard PAYE)
4. Annual taxable income calculation method
5. Previous months YTD figures correct

**Q: UIF deduction exceeds R177.12**

A: Check:
1. Salary component formula: `min(gross_pay * 0.01, 177.12)`
2. UIF threshold updated (R17,712 monthly cap)
3. Additional salaries not double-counting

**Q: IRP5 totals don't match EMP201**

A: Reconcile:
1. IRP5 = per employee for tax year
2. EMP201 = monthly submissions total
3. Check for missed months
4. Verify employee count
5. Review mid-year joins/leaves

**Q: Business Trip not generating Expense Claim**

A: Check:
1. Business Trip Settings > "Auto Create Expense Claim" = ✅
2. Business Trip status = "Submitted"
3. Expense Claim Type configured
4. Employee has manager assigned (if approval required)

**Q: CSV import failing for Business Trip Regions**

A: Verify:
1. CSV file encoding (UTF-8)
2. Numeric values in correct format (1500 not "1,500")
3. Required fields: region_name, daily_allowance_rate
4. File path: `za_local/data/business_trip_region.csv`

### Error Messages

**Error:** "Document Links Row #1: Invalid doctype or fieldname"

**Solution:** This error during installation means a DocType Link references a non-existent field. Check `hooks.py` for invalid link configurations. All DocType Links have been validated in v3.1.

**Error:** "Custom field already exists"

**Solution:** During reinstall, custom fields may already exist. The system skips duplicates automatically. If persistent, manually delete custom fields via Customize Form before reinstall.

**Error:** "'<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'"

**Solution:** CSV import type conversion issue (fixed in v3.1). Ensure `csv_importer.py` includes `convert_csv_types()` function.

### Performance Optimization

**Large Payroll (500+ employees):**
1. Process payroll in batches (by department)
2. Increase timeout settings
3. Schedule during off-peak hours
4. Use background jobs

**Slow Reports:**
1. Add database indexes on frequently queried fields
2. Limit date ranges
3. Filter by company/department
4. Export to Excel for complex analysis
