**Date**: October 31, 2024  
**Application**: ZA Local v3.2.0  
**Tax Year**: 2025-2026 (March 1, 2025 - February 28, 2026)

## Executive Summary

### Audit Scope

- Tax calculations (PAYE, rebates, medical credits)
- Statutory deductions (UIF, SDL)
- Employment Tax Incentive (ETI)
- SARS submissions (EMP201, EMP501, IRP5)

### Overall Status: ✅ COMPLIANT (with critical fixes applied)

---

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Tax Rebate Calculation Logic (CRITICAL BUG FIX)
**Issue**: Function referenced incorrect field names causing complete failure of tax rebate calculations.

**Location**: `za_local/utils/tax_utils.py` lines 70-122

**Problem**:
- Code referenced `rebate_settings.rebate_rates` (incorrect)
- Looped through rebates checking for `rebate.rebate_type` and `rebate.amount` (fields don't exist)

**Actual DocType Structure**:
- Table field: `tax_rebates_rate` (not `rebate_rates`)
- Child fields: `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary` (direct currency fields)

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# OLD (BROKEN):
if not rebate_settings or not rebate_settings.rebate_rates:
    ...
for rebate in rebate_settings.rebate_rates:
    if rebate.rebate_type == "Primary":
        total_rebate += flt(rebate.amount)

# NEW (FIXED):
if not rebate_settings or not rebate_settings.tax_rebates_rate:
    ...
rebate = rebate_settings.tax_rebates_rate[0]
total_rebate += flt(rebate.primary)
if age >= 65:
    total_rebate += flt(rebate.secondary)
if age >= 75:
    total_rebate += flt(rebate.tertiary)
```

**Impact**: HIGH - Without this fix, NO tax rebates were being applied, resulting in massive over-taxation.

---

### 2. Medical Tax Credit Calculation Logic (CRITICAL BUG FIX)
**Issue**: Function referenced incorrect table field name causing complete failure.

**Location**: `za_local/utils/tax_utils.py` lines 125-173

**Problem**:
- Code referenced `credit_settings.medical_tax_credit_rates` (incorrect)
- Correct field name: `medical_tax_credit`

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# OLD (BROKEN):
if not credit_settings or not credit_settings.medical_tax_credit_rates:
    ...
credit = credit_settings.medical_tax_credit_rates[0]

# NEW (FIXED):
if not credit_settings or not credit_settings.medical_tax_credit:
    ...
credit = credit_settings.medical_tax_credit[0]
```

**Impact**: HIGH - Medical aid tax credits were not being applied correctly.

## Validation Results

### Phase 1: Tax Calculations ✅ VALIDATED

#### PAYE Calculation
**Status**: ✅ CORRECT  
**Method**: Delegates to HRMS `calculate_tax_by_tax_slab()` which correctly applies progressive brackets.  
**Tested Against**: 2025-2026 tax slabs with cumulative thresholds.

#### Tax Rebate Calculation
**Status**: ✅ FIXED  
**Method**: Now correctly accesses `tax_rebates_rate[0]` and reads `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary` fields.  
**Logic**: Cumulative rebates correctly applied based on age (65+, 75+).

#### Medical Tax Credit Calculation
**Status**: ✅ FIXED  
**Method**: Now correctly accesses `medical_tax_credit[0]` table.  
**Logic**: Correctly calculates based on number of dependants using `one_dependant`, `two_dependant`, `additional_dependant` fields.

---

### Phase 2: Statutory Deductions ✅ VALIDATED

#### UIF Contributions
**Status**: ✅ CORRECT  
**Employee**: 1% capped at R177.12  
**Employer**: 1% capped at R177.12  
**Total**: 2% reported on EMP201

**Verified**:
- Formula in salary components: `min(gross_pay * 0.01, 177.12)`
- Company contribution child table populated correctly
- Cap applied at R17,712 earnings threshold

#### SDL Contributions
**Status**: ✅ CORRECT  
**Rate**: 1% uncapped  
**Employer Only**: Correctly tracked in company_contribution child table  
**Formula**: `gross_pay * 0.01`

---

### Phase 3: ETI Calculations ✅ VALIDATED

**Status**: ✅ LOGIC CORRECT

**Eligibility Checks**:
- ✅ Age 18-29 on last day of month
- ✅ First 24 months employment
- ✅ Hired after Oct 1, 2013
- ✅ Valid SA ID number

**Calculation**:
- ✅ Correctly selects First/Second 12-month slab
- ✅ Applies bracket-based formulas
- ✅ Pro-rates for part-time employees (hours < 160)

**Formula Implementation**:
- Percentage-based: `(percentage/100) * remuneration`
- Fixed amount: `eti_amount`
- Declining: `eti_amount - ((percentage/100) * (remuneration - from_amount))`

---

### Phase 4: SARS Submissions ✅ VALIDATED

#### EMP201 Monthly Submission
**Status**: ✅ CORRECT

**Calculation Logic**:
1. Gross PAYE = Sum of PAYE deductions
2. UIF = Employee UIF + Employer UIF (from company_contribution)
3. SDL = Sum of SDL (from company_contribution)
4. ETI Generated = Sum of ETI earnings components
5. ETI Utilized = min(Gross PAYE, Total ETI Available)
6. Net PAYE = Gross PAYE - ETI Utilized
7. ETI Carried Forward = Total ETI - ETI Utilized

**Formula**: `Total Due = Net PAYE + UIF + SDL`

**Verified**: EMP201 correctly aggregates from submitted salary slips and handles ETI carry-forward from previous month.

#### IRP5 Tax Certificates
**Status**: ✅ SARS CODES VERIFIED

**Income Codes**:
- 3601: Gross Remuneration (Basic Salary)
- 3605: Annual Payments (Bonuses, Leave Encashment)
- 3607: Overtime
- 3701: Travel Allowance (Taxable)
- 3704: Subsistence Allowance
- 3713: Uniform Allowance

**Deduction Codes**:
- 4001: Pension Fund Contribution (Employee)
- 4005: Medical Scheme Fees (Employee)
- 4006: Retirement Annuity Fund
- 4102: PAYE
- 4116: Medical Tax Credit
- 4141: UIF Contribution
- 4142: SDL
- 4472: Employer Pension Contribution
- 4474: Employer Medical Contribution
- **4497: Company Contributions** (UIF Employer, SDL, COIDA)

---

### Phase 5: Employment Equity Act ✅ NOTED

#### Designated Employer Threshold (2025 Change)
**Previous**: 50+ employees OR turnover threshold  
**New (from Jan 1, 2025)**: 50+ employees ONLY (turnover removed)

**Current Implementation**: EE reports generate for all companies. The 50+ threshold applies to **submission requirement**, not report generation.

**Action**: ✅ NO CODE CHANGE NEEDED - Reports work correctly. Submission requirement is a business process decision.

#### EE Reports Validated
- ✅ EEA2 Income Differentials: Correctly queries `za_occupational_level`, `za_race`, `gender`
- ✅ EEA4 Employment Equity Plan: Tracks targets and progress
- ✅ Workforce Profile: Breakdowns by demographics

**Required Custom Fields** (verified present):
- `za_race` on Employee
- `za_occupational_level` on Employee  
- `za_disability_status` on Employee

---

### Phase 6: Skills Development Act ✅ VALIDATED

#### SETA DocType
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (seta.py was missing, now created)

**Verified**:
- 24 SETAs loadable from CSV
- Company custom field `za_seta` exists
- SDL correctly creates journal entry to liability account

#### WSP & ATR
**Status**: ✅ DocTypes EXIST

- Workplace Skills Plan: Tracks training needs, budget, June 30 deadline

- Family Responsibility: 3 days/year
- Maternity: 4 months unpaid
- Paternity: 10 days (from Aug 2023)
- Parental: 10 days (adoptive/commissioning)

**Note**: Leave type setup is handled by HRMS. ZA Local provides leave encashment calculations for termination.

---

**Frappe Framework Provides**:
- Role-based access controls
- Audit trails (version control on all DocTypes)
- Data deletion protection
